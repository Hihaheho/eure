# eure-schema

Schema definition and validation for EURE.

This crate provides a schema system for EURE files, allowing for validation, type checking, and enhanced editor support.

**This crate is still under development and published for name reservation purpose.**

Part of the [EURE](https://eure.dev) project - a minimalist, schema-friendly format with an algebraic data model that's compatible with JSON.
