# swon-schema

Schema definition and validation for SWON (SWan Object Notation).

This crate provides a schema system for SWON files, allowing for validation, type checking, and enhanced editor support.

**This crate is still under development and published for name reservation purpose.**

Part of the [SWON](https://swon.dev) project - a minimalist, schema-friendly format with an algebraic data model that's compatible with JSON.
