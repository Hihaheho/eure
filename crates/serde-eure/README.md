# serde-eure

Serde support for the EURE format.

This crate provides serialization and deserialization support for EURE using Serde, allowing you to easily convert between Rust data structures and EURE.

**This crate is still under development and published for name reservation purpose.**

Part of the [EURE](https://eure.dev) project - a minimalist, schema-friendly format with an algebraic data model that's compatible with JSON.
