# serde-swon

Serde support for the SWON (SWan Object Notation) format.

This crate provides serialization and deserialization support for SWON using Serde, allowing you to easily convert between Rust data structures and SWON.

**This crate is still under development and published for name reservation purpose.**

Part of the [SWON](https://swon.dev) project - a minimalist, schema-friendly format with an algebraic data model that's compatible with JSON.
